# CiDer üçπ

This repository implements **CiDer: A Black-box Approach to Classify Node with Certified Robustness Guarantees** in **IEEE INFOCOM 2025**.

---

## üß† Paper Overview

CiDer introduces a novel **black-box certified robustness** framework for node classification. It leverages a denoiser-based model to provide provable guarantees on the classification robustness of graph nodes under adversarial perturbations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiaoyuu-liang/CiDer.git
cd CiDer
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or, use conda
```bash
conda create -n cider python=3.10
conda activate cider
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Train and Test
Start from the denoiser training, then run classification and evaluation:
```bash
# Modify the configs and train the denoiser
python denoiser.py

# Train the classification model
python train_gnn.py
```
